## Overview
This Python project is designed for testing VPN services using Xray, a versatile tool for network traffic inspection and manipulation. It provides a flexible framework to assess VPN performance, reliability, and security features across VMess, VLESS, Trojan, and Shadowsocks protocols.

## Features
- **Protocol Support**: Test VPN protocols including VMess, VLESS, Trojan, and Shadowsocks.
- **Performance Metrics**: Measure latency, throughput, and connection stability under various conditions.
- **Security Evaluation**: Assess DNS leakage, IP address concealment, and traffic encryption strength for each supported protocol.
- **Automation**: Automate tests for scalability and repeatability using Python scripts.
- **Report Generation**: Generate detailed reports with test results and recommendations.
